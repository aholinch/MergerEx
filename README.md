# MergerEx
Merger Explorer - Tools to explore simulations of interacting galaxies

JSPAM
=====
The JSPAM repository is also hosted on GitHub.  However, a precompiled 
version is distributed with MergerEx for convenience.  If new features
are added to JSPAM, MergerEx can catch-up later without fear of changes
in the simulation code breaking this application.
